  Abstract

  Cervical cancer is a malignant tumor originating from the cervix of the uterus. The malignancy persists in the cervical cells over time, leading to gradual cellular mutations. As the disease progresses, it may develop into precancerous lesions, eventually evolving into cervical cancer. Since cervical cancer often does not exhibit obvious symptoms in its early stages, regular cervical screening through Pap smears is crucial for the effective prevention of cervical-related abnormalities. Although Pap smears are helpful for screening, they cannot provide detailed insights into the lesions and may pose observational challenges due to factors such as poor smear quality. For more accurate diagnosis of lesions, colposcopic imaging examinations are required.

  Imaging examinations include original colposcopic images, acetic acid-stained colposcopic images, and iodine-stained colposcopic images. By directly observing the cervical surface, physicians can better assess the degree of surface lesions and various vascular abnormalities, which helps determine the severity of the lesions and the necessity for further biopsy.

  This study involves a total of 1,758 patients, with each patient having three types of colposcopic image data and age textual data. After preprocessing, which includes resizing and contrast enhancement, the processed image size is 512×512. Data augmentation techniques were applied to increase the diversity of the dataset. The study is primarily focused on two objectives：predicting the severity of cervical lesions in patients and segmenting four types of lesion areas in colposcopic acetic acid-stained images.

  In predicting the severity of cervical lesions, this study employed a multi-modal model that integrates four modalities：colposcopic images, colposcopic acetic acid-stained images, colposcopic iodine-stained images, and age data. The severity of the lesions was classified into four grades—mild dysplasia, moderate dysplasia, severe dysplasia, and carcinoma in situ—based on the pathological diagnosis report. The study involved 1,758 patients, who were divided into training, validation, and test sets in a 3：1：1 ratio. A 5-fold data augmentation technique was employed to enhance the model’s generalization capability. The loss function used was Categorical Cross Entropy, and the evaluation metric was accuracy. The experimental results showed that, when using all four modalities, the model achieved an accuracy of 88.7% on the test set. When using three modalities (colposcopic images, colposcopic acetic acid-stained images, and colposcopic iodine-stained images), the model achieved an accuracy of 83.6% on the test set. When using two modalities (colposcopic images and colposcopic iodine-stained images), the model achieved an accuracy of 75.7% on the test set. These results indicate that the multi-modal model achieved the best performance when utilizing all four modalities, with an overall accuracy of 88.7%. Specifically, the accuracy for mild dysplasia was 85.4%, for moderate dysplasia 79.6%, for severe dysplasia 69.8%, and for carcinoma in situ 75.4%.

  In the segmentation of colposcopic acetic acid-stained images, this study employed the DeepLabv3+ semantic segmentation model to segment four types of lesion areas：acetowhite areas, punctate vascular abnormality areas, mosaic vascular abnormality areas, and atypical vascular abnormality areas. The dataset consisted of 700 patients who underwent conization, out of a total of 1,758 patients. Due to the relatively small size of the segmentation dataset, the training set was expanded, and the data were split into training, validation, and test sets in an 8：1：1 ratio, with a 12-fold data augmentation technique applied. The loss function used was Categorical Cross Entropy, and the evaluation metrics included MIoU, Recall, and Hit Rate. The experimental results showed that DeepLabv3+ achieved better segmentation performance on larger targets, such as acetowhite areas and mosaic vascular abnormality areas, but performed relatively poorly on smaller targets, such as punctate vascular abnormality areas and atypical vascular abnormality areas. The overall MIoU reached 0.773, with the MIoU for acetowhite areas at 0.881, Recall at 0.942, and Hit Rate at 0.931; for punctate vascular abnormality areas, the MIoU was 0.501, Recall was 0.624, and Hit Rate was 0.718; for mosaic vascular abnormality areas, the MIoU was 0.802, Recall was 0.880, and Hit Rate was 0.900; and for atypical vascular abnormality areas, the MIoU was 0.676, Recall was 0.778, and Hit Rate was 0.837. To further evaluate the performance of the segmentation model, this study conducted a multi-label classification evaluation on the segmentation results of the colposcopic acetic acid-stained images to determine whether the model could accurately identify and classify all lesion types present in the images. The multi-label classification evaluation metrics were divided into two categories：those considering only completely correct predictions and those considering partially correct predictions. The evaluation method for completely correct predictions was Subset Accuracy, while the metrics for partially correct predictions included Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Hamming Loss. The evaluation results on the test set showed a Subset Accuracy of 0.588, an Accuracy of 0.710, a Precision of 0.992, a Recall of 0.713, an F1-score of 0.754, and a Hamming Loss of 0.180. Although the model achieved a Precision of 0.992, the relatively lower Recall (0.713) and Subset Accuracy (0.588) indicate that the model still has limitations in identifying all lesion types, particularly for smaller lesions such as punctate vascular abnormality areas and atypical vascular abnormality areas. Overall, the multi-label classification results suggest that while the model demonstrates a certain level of performance in identifying and classifying the four types of lesions in colposcopic acetic acid-stained images, there remains room for improvement in enhancing its comprehensive identification capabilities.
